    <h2>Welcome to Abducted, a puzzle game.</h2>
    <p>You are walking down the street, when suddenly a shadow appears overhead. You start too look up, but your vision goes dark.</p>
    <p>You wake up at what seems like a spa<strong>c</strong>eship, and y<strong>o</strong>u feel like it has bee<strong>n</strong> a pretty long <strong>t</strong>ime. The<strong>r</strong>e is a window t<strong>o</strong> your right, and you can te<strong>l</strong>l that you are defenitly in sp<strong>a</strong>ce.</p>
    <p>With not much of a choice you must make your way out of the large spaceship.</p>
