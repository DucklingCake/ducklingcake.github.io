			<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>This page has some info about who I am.</p>
		<p>Hello, I'm Leo. I'm currently a teenage boy living in the United States. I have a passion for a lot of things including art, baking, programming, writing, school, walking on stilts, being unique and cool, and a ton of other stuff. If you check out some of the pages linked in the naviagtion bar above, you should learn some more about some of these. A lot of people ask me what I'd like to be when I'm older, but I really have no idea.</p>
		<p>School is a pretty big part of my life. I spend about 35% of the time that I'm awake at school, and probably 45% of my time I'm either at school or doing school work. Thats a lot. I'm a pretty good student in school. I'm currently a few grades ahead of my grade level in math and spanish, my reading level is way ahead of my grade, I do super well in all of my classes in general. My favorite class in school is probably Language Arts, but I also really love Science, Social Studies, Math, and pretty much all of my classes. I really love to be able to go above and beyond for some assigments that I find really interesting, and I like being able to work independently. At the end of this school year, my grade is taking a trip to New York, which I'm super excited about. My school also runs a yearly project that is called Dream Homework, Learning Without Walls, Learning Challenge, or Apature depending on what grade/level you are at. For my project I'm going to be working on fundraising, and I'll be hosting several things (hopefully) including a Fall Dance, Fashion Show, Talent Show, Hunger Games, Dancing with the Stars type show, some sort of Art Show, a Concert, and possibly more.</p>
