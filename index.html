			<h2 style="color:white">About</h2>
		<p style="color:white">I am a cool person. Welcome to my website! Below you can find a few sections that have stuff in them, so yeah. B)</p>
			<h2 style="color:white">Scratch</h2>
		</div>
		<p style="color:white">I am on Scratch a lot, with the username ZLGames. I love Scratch, and probably spend way too much time on it. I love to help out people with their projects, and on the forums. I have over 300 followers on Scratch, and I have been front paged over five times. I can generally be found browsing the requests forum, but I also do various other things on Scratch. I voice act quite frequently and have starred in several animations. I also work on a lot of projects and had a few of them curated and top loved. After I learned to program in Scratch, I started to use other programming languages, but I will talk about that more in the next section.</p>

			<h2 style="color:white">Programming</h2>
		<p style="color:white">As said above, after I knew how to program in Scratch, I started learning other languages. I currently know how to program well in HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, and Ruby. I know how to program in HTML and CSS the best. I am currently working on learning a lot more Python so I can start to create some advanced games.</p>
