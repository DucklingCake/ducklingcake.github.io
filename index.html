			<h2>About</h2>
		<p>I am a cool person. Welcome to my website! Below you can find a few sections that have stuff in them, so yeah. B) I just started this website so right now it is basically just plain old text. I plan on adding a lot more to this later to make it look <em><span>fancified</span></em>.</p>
			<h2>Interests</h2>
		<p>Below is just a simple list of some things that I'm intersted in.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Reading<br />
			I love reading, and probably read about a book almost every week. I'm currently reading the Mortal Instruments series.
			<li>Programming/Scratching<br />
			This is talked about below, so look there. :)
			<li>Graphic Design<br />
			I quite like graphic design, and I frequently design and create things.
