    <h1>Abducted</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to Abducted, a puzzle game.</h2>
    <p>You are walking down the street, when suddenly a shadow appears overhead. You start too look up, but your vision goes dark.</p>
    <p>You wake up at what seems like a spaceship, and you feel like it has been a pretty long time.</p>
    <p>With not much of a choice you must make your way out of the spaceship.</p>
