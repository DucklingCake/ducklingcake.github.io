			<h2>About</h2>
		<p>On this page, I may share some pieces of writing that I have done, this will include anything from small haikus and other little poems I write to massive, collaborative, endless stories written with loads of other people. I am also a pretty diverse writer. One of my favorite genres to write is poetry, but I also love fantasy novels and I dream of writing one.</p> 
			<h2>Writing</h2>
		<p>Below is the prologue for a story that I'm writing. Currently, it does not have a title.</p>
		<p>Simon had been sitting in the crowded bar for some time now. The buzz of conversations filled the room. Simon looked around the room. It was clear--due to the cracked windows, rotting furniture and odd smell--that this place had been around for a long time. That still did not stop the building from being filled up with people every day. The reason that Simon was here was probably different from the reasons that everyone else was here. They were here to have fun, talk, gamble. Simon was here because of a note. A note that was left in his house. Simon had figured out, over the years, that anyone who could find him was probably someone worth talking to. The note had only said five words, “Serpent Bar, table thirteen, midnight.” There couldn’t be anything wrong with going, Milo and Claire would be scattered around the bar, and would be ready to help if anything happened. And that's exactly where Simon was now. At the Serpent Bar, sitting at table thirteen. It was midnight when he got here, but now some time had passed. He wasn’t sure what time it was anymore. Simon was about to get up, thinking the whole thing had been some sort of joke.Then someone walked into the room. This wasn’t a normal person. For one, when he walked in a hush fell over the crowd. The people obviously knew who the man was. Simon didn’t -- after all, he does practically live under a rock. The man walked directly towards Simon’s table. After the people saw that the man wasn’t coming to them, they started talking again. It was almost as if they were relieved that the man wasn’t coming to them. <br />
		<p>“Sorry I’m late, I --” the man stuttered, “Was caught up.” the man finally finished. He had a very gruff voice, and Simon could tell he was old, despite the fact the his face was covered up by a black hood. In fact, all his clothes were completely black. Simon opened his mouth to reply, but no sound came out. Simon wasn’t often scared, he had been through a lot in the time he had been alive. Even though the man seemed completely normal, Simon was absolutely terrified. “I suppose you are wondering why I’ve asked you to come here.” The man removed his hood, and Simon could see that he was right about the age of the man. “You see, I’ve been looking for someone. Someone who can help me.”</p>
		<p>“And what would you need help with?” Simon finally asked.</p>
		<p>“Before I tell you Simon, I--”</p>
		<p>“How do you know my name?” Simon asked, a little too loudly. People from the nearby tables looked over at them.</p>
		<p>“I’ll tell you everything you want to know soon enough.” The man said, “I have been informed that you are a great fighter and mercenary. And I think because of this, you may be able to help me. Could you give me an example, a story per se, of one of your adventures. After this I will explain everything you want to know.”</p>
		<p>“I guess I could give you an example.” Simon finally said after thinking over what the man had told him. And so Simon began the tale of his most recent adventure.</p>
		<p>By the end of Simon’s story, the man was grinning. “Perfect. You’ll do perfect.” The man paused, and Simon wondered if he was going to continue, but before Simon could ask, the man said “I need you to kill The Emperor.”</p><br />
		<p>The next thing I have here is a poem that I recently wrote for a school assignment where we has to write a personal narrative. I do not usually include things I have done in school on here, but I really liked how this piece turned out so I decided to add it. My poem is titled "The Balloon."</p>
		<p>My name.<br />
		It is short, but too many syllables. <br />
		Uncommon, but there are many that share it. <br />
		It seems distant, <br />
		Like a balloon that has floated away,<br />
		Just out of my grasp.<br />
		A red speck splattered onto the bright blue shining sky.<br /></p>

		<p>It sounds different.</p>

		<p>A lion, tough and strong.<br />
		A blazing ball of yellow fur, <br />
		Roaring through the day —<br />
		But a quiet snore fills the air at night.<br />
		Like the zodiac.<br />
		The one that says I am a born leader, dramatic and lazy.<br />
		That I’m self centered but passionate and warm hearted.<br />
		The constellation<br />
		The nine stars that share my name,<br />
		A lion that terrorized citizens and could not be brought down<br />
		But was strangled and placed in the heavens <br /></p>

		<p>My name is a darkness, but one where sanguineness still remains.<br />
		A darkened room, with a glint of a dimmed out flashlight,<br />
		One that is losing strength. A flashlight that will soon be no more.<br />
		But still, the tiny bit of hope remains. <br />
		It is different — a single sock,<br />
		The other lost in piles of responsibilities and tasks,<br />
		A place where it looks like there is no light at the end.<br /></p> 

		<p>The small fire remains,<br />
		Something that is unable to be extinguished,<br />
		My name is complicated — the depths and darkness of sorrow come forwards,<br />
		Looming like a pit of unawareness and misdirection,<br />
		A dark storm cloud moving over the sky.<br />
		But the sky is not covered, it remains unmasked,  <br />
		A diminutive hope<br /></p>

		<p>The hope that may be gone soon,<br />
		But for now it remains.<br />
		The sock endures through everything thrown at it,<br />
		The fire remains untouched,<br />
		And the balloon floats away.<br /></p>
